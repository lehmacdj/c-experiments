This directory contains executables that do the very dangerous thing of hard
linking anything to something else.  While doing this the following rules are
very important to maintain filesystem integrity:
1. The file system must be journaled HFS+.
2. The parent directories of the source and destination must be different.
3. The source’s parent must not be the root directory.
4. The destination must not be in the root directory.
5. The destination must not be a descendent of the source.
6. The destination must not have any ancestor that’s a directory hard link.
Otherwise it is relatively likely that the filesystem could become corrupt or
that other things could be broken.

It is important to keep a log of hard linked directories made and is also
essential to unlink them using hunlink.  The log of hardlinked files is at
/private/var/root/bin/hard_links/LOGFILE

Compiling and using the programs is very dangerous.  Do with caution.
