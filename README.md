# Datastructures

Various datastructures/algorithms/test programs implemented in C. These have
been written over the course of several years and are thus of differing quality.

Each directory should contain some kind of `Makefile`, or individual files
should include instructions for compilation. Where applicable there may be some
kind of tests that should be runnable with a `Makefile`.
